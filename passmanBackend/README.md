PassMan - The password manager for the paranoid. 
This repository represents the backend logic of the password manager. The logic is defined as a REST API using Django and Django REST Framework.
The API is used by accessing several endpoints and invoking the functionality abstracted from that endpoint.

Please note that this is under testing and has not finished development. The code must be cleaned and neatly documented.

Also, this is intended to be run in a localhost environment or a limited client environment. The fact being that the password vaults are created in your system and only you have access to it.
This part of behavior can be changed of course if you would like.

If you would only like to test this and not do any development, You can use the docker container instead of manually building the repo.
You can find my docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sharanvarma0/passman-backend).
